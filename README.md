# Viridian frontend mockup

This is the HTML, CSS, and JS based (with Vue.js) mockup code that is supposed
to go into a full-fledged platform-independent Progressive Web App (based on
Vue.js) eventually. It is just the first attempt of the layout and look-and-feel
of the frontend app for the Viridian network.
